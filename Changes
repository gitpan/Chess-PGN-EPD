        - added epdset; allows user to specify the initial position for a game

0.04  Sat Feb 09 00:49:55 2002

0.05  Fri Feb 15 15:27:33 2002

      Sun Feb 17 13:47:56 2002
        - documentation patch, remove dummy comment from README
0.06  Wed Feb 20 14:23:00 2002
        - jump from 0.04 to 0.06 because I forgot to change the $VERSION in the last upload
	- made necessary changes to Makefile.pl in order to install Berkeley DB files used
	  by epdcode()
	- added epdcode; converts epd array to one of ECO code, NIC code or Opening name
      Thu Feb 21 07:24:28 2002
        - documentation patch, CHESS::PGN -> Chess::PGN, PGN::PGNParser -> PGN::Parse
	- patched Makefile.pl, install:: -> install ::, spaces are important!
	- added code to find DB files at BEGIN{}
0.07  Sun Mar 10 08:37:35 2002
        - yet more documentation fixes - remove misleading script names from examples
	- added DB_File to dependancy list in changes
	- removed 'taxonomy' from TODO list
	- add 'palview' to epdstr type
	- add 'text' to epdstr type
0.08  Wed Mar 20 19:55:48 2002
        - add %font2map lookup table
0.09  Sat Mar 30 18:58:00 2002
	- correct make test bug, $db_path needs default value of './db/' since test happens
	  before install
0.10  Mon Apr 01 15:03:27 2002
	- correct Makefile.PL to use '/' in list of files, not '\' which fails under Linux
0.11  Tue Apr 02 09:08:21 2002
	- must correct target of modified file list as well, 
	  not 'Chess/PGN/db' but 'Chess\PGN\db'
0.12  Tue Apr 02 13:54:01 2002
	- patch for permissions bug, db files are created 0644, so should access in
	  read-only mode
	- also remove INIT block as un-necessary
0.13  Mon Jun 24 04:23:01 2002
	- fold in patch for 'Malformed UTF-8 character (byte 0xfe) in ord...' problem found
	  by Cyril Malkov - patch is his too!
	- add better test.pl file
0.14  Mon Jun 24 17:00:36 2002
	- re-synchronize Makefile.PL to use the one with all of the corrections in it
0.15  Wed Jun 26 20:25:38 2002
	- figured out that MANIFEST should reflect what you want in the distribution,
	  but it should do so in a unix like fashion - similar to problem found in
	  version .10
	- corrected other typo in README (version should be current, not 0.12!)
