Chess/PGN/EPD version 0.30
==========================

CHESS::PGN::EPD - Perl extension to produce and manipulate EPD text.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To install this module under Windows type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

NOTE: case is optional in Windows
NOTE: if completely installed using assoc and ftype then you can type the following:

   makefile
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

Note: if you haven't installed using assoc and ftype then type the following:

   help ftype

for instructions. You may find the example to be in error, a matter of where to
put quotes and such. From a dos box:

C:\>assoc .pl
.pl=Perl

C:\>ftype Perl
Perl="C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe" "%1" %*

This works for Windows from W2k through Vista.

my development machine. To tell the truth, I'm not entirely sure that 'most current'
is really needed. If you have problems, experiment!
